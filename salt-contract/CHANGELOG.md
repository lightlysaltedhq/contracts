# Changelog — @lightlysaltedhq/salt-contract

Newest first. Dates are DD/MM/YYYY. What each part of a version means, and how a breaking change is
announced and migrated, is in `RELEASE-POLICY.md`. Decisions cited as `SC-nnn` are in Lightly
Salted's decision log for Product Salt.

## Unreleased (0.1.0, drafting)

- The package exists, with its gate (`npm run salt-contract` at the repository root) and its
  release workflow on the `salt-contract-v*` tag prefix. It stays `private` until 1.0.0.
- `RELEASE-POLICY.md`: one version for the package, what is major, minor and patch for every kind
  of artefact, deprecation over at least one minor, a machine-readable migration file for every
  major, exact pins and the lag rule for implementations, and staged releases with provenance.
- `contract/sections.json` (`./sections`, schema `./schema/sections`): the vocabulary. 17 sections
  (16 core, pricing at the edge), 29 components and 7 page views, each with the names and stored
  option values Salt for Next.js 0.11.0 and salt-wordpress 5.0.0 used before, so each platform's
  renames can be generated. Every current Next.js block and WordPress layout is mapped; WordPress
  `intro` folds into `rich-text`, and its five collection layouts into `collection-showcase`
  (testimonials as a slider into `carousel`). Three open questions are recorded in the file.
